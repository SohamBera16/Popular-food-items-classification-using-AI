# Image based popular food items classification using AI and corresponding Web application deployment for end-users using Heroku

 * ### Problem Statement : 
In today's world, each and every one of us click thousands of images in our daily lives, and one of the most popular categories of these images is *food items*. No matter whether we go to a aesthetically appealing new restaurant or make a delicious meal in our home, we almost always make sure that the memory finds it place in our social media feeds. This massive amount of data can be leveraged by cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology to gain insights about the personal as well as regional/global trends of food consumption habits as well as various correlations with other factors. This knowledge can be extremely useful to figure out optimum diet plans, financial plans to tackle the overspending habits on junk foods, and how different food items contribute to the overall obesity factors to maintain our peak biological performance level.

Hence, the first and most important step of this process is to make the machines smarter in terms of visual perception and understanding/categorization capabilities for different & popular food items. This project attempts to make an algorithm so that a computer can automatically detect a certain food type from an image and create the framework for further analysis and knowledge discovery.

 * ### Challenges: 
 Lack of available open-source datasets, tackling the long training time constraints for computationally demanding deep learning tech. 
 
 * ### Technology Implementation: 
Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Deep Learning techniques - in particular, the MobileNet V2 model has been used for implementing transfer learning along with the    Convolutional Neural network (CNN) tech in order to automate the process of food item image detection. Afterwards, Heroku the Heroku platform was utilized to deploy the app into production for the demo of automated image classification results. 
    
 * ### Dataset used: 
 The dataset used for this project has been downloaded from - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msarmi9/food101tiny
 Some of the example food items to classify are - chocolate cakes, chicken curry, chicken wings, pizza, cup cakes, sandwich, etc. 
    
 * ### Results:
